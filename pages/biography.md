### Biography

My name is Junhao Huang. I am currently a postdoc fellow at City University of Hong Kong, under the guidance of [Prof. Ray. C.C. Cheung](https://cityuhk-calas.github.io/). I obtained my PhD degree from Hong Kong Baptist University in 2025. My PhD supervisor is [Dr. Donglong Chen](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=kFDs-OMAAAAJ&hl=en) at Beijing Normal-Hong Kong Baptist University. My research interest lies in cryptographic engineering, focusing on efficient implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Lattice-based Cryptography (LBC). My previous research positions and education history can be found in my [CV](/assets/JunhaoHuang_CV/jhhuang_cv.pdf).
