### Biography

My name is Junhao Huang. I am currently a PhD student at [BNU-HKBU United International College](https://www.uic.edu.cn), under the guidance of [Dr. Donglong Chen](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=kFDs-OMAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interest lies in cryptographic engineering, which mainly includes efficient implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Lattice-based Cryptography (LBC).
