title: Hi, I'm Junhao
subtitle: PhD student in Cryptographic Engineering.

I am a PhD student at Johns Hopkins University, working in the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP), advised
by Sanjeev Khudanpur and Dan Povey. My research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for speech
and language tasks. I am currently working on speech recognition and speaker diarization for multi-talker recordings.

I graduated from IIT Guwahati in 2017 with a major in Computer Science. My bachelor thesis was on deep learning methods
for relation extraction in clinical text, supervised by Ashish Anand.

When Iâ€™m not doing ML, I like to work out, climb boulders, play guitar, and read fiction.
