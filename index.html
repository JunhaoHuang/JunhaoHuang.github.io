### Biography
I am a PhD student at BNU-HKBU United International College, under the guidance of Dr. Donglong Chen. My research interests include efficient implementation of (Post-quantum) Public Key Cryptography (PKC). I am currently working on speech recognition and speaker diarization for multi-talker recordings.

I graduated from IIT Guwahati in 2017 with a major in Computer Science. My bachelor thesis was on deep learning methods
for relation extraction in clinical text, supervised by Ashish Anand.

When I'm not doing ML, I like to work out, climb boulders, play guitar, and read fiction.
